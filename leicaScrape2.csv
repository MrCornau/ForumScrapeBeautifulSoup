	If or when say M11 is out..Ok Traditional Leica M with Rangefinder say 40-50 MPX improved buffer and all same size and same layout as always price tag $9500 us .. Great all good 


	Now along side they release another camera for the M No range finder .. high Rez EVF.. Ibis .. 40-50MPX..electronic shutter, stacked sensor .. Video.. manual focus M mount ... Made in Japan not Germany.. But high quality standards.  Relatively same size and layout of the M ...at $3500.00 US. Would you Buy one ??

	Since this is a hypothetical question, my answer would be a ""yes"" - hypothetically, of course.


	I would not buy the hypothetical Japan made camera instead of an M11 but as an adjunct to the M11.


	All the above is contingent upon my suddenly experiencing an unexpected financial windfall so that I would have the hard currency to buy both hypothetical cameras.  As it turns out, attempting to buy any M camera or lens with hypothetical money yields the same end result as attempting to buy with the much ballyhooed ""exposure dollars"" that companies who want photographers to work for free always dangle in front of us.

	For me the second option is well covered with so many other mirrorless cameras on the market for some years now. Besides if your mystery camera is Leica FF @ $3500...hell did in fact freeze over and we have other problems to deal with 😉🙃


	Seriously, IMO the SL2/S are such great options with all the mirrorless bells and whistles for adapting M lenses and on the shelves available for purchase as I type its really hard to dream of anything else.


	The Leica Rangefinder is however a completely different love affair for me. Not really looking for another lovely at the moment. As the M10-R is Simply Irresistible according to Robert Palmer's definition. *May he RIP.

	I clearly said if Leica brought out a M mount EVF camera with full frame With some good specs would you buy one to accompany your rangefinder.


	look at what they did with the SL 24-70 2.8.   Gave Sl users a choice. 24-90. Made in Germany. 7500.00 ......24-70. Made in Japan 3500 dollars 


	they say the reason M is very expensive  is the rangefinder mech.. German wages .. and so on.  Well there are options

	I think it would be a wonderful platform to use with the variety of rather difficult lenses to work with such as the 75 .. wide angles noctilux and so on 


	I also think it would be great way for an entry into the system on price point.. nice option when you don’t want to risk a 10,000 dollar investment in certain situations.. a so called expansion of versatility.. sort of what the CL was to the system 50 years ago.

	For me any camera capable of using ‘M’ glass well has got to be worth a look although I am not certain if your hypothetical price point is achievable or a bit of science fiction to sway the voters.  
	 


	Anyway …would I buy a car which still got me from A to B made by the same manufacturer and carried the same ethos but which was 35% of their current prices and had stuff I didn’t really need like lane change assist bla bla bla but offered a less engaging and enjoyable experience when driving?


	For sure I would - for my digital cameras  - if you chuck in weather sealing - and I would also be more willing to consider upgrades if and when at that price.


	However saying that I’m more than certain that would make using my Mechanical M a little bit more special.

Edax",91 posts,10/30/2021 08:43  PM,"


	The answer is NO. Because it most probably will rely on contrast-based manual focussing (with optional magnification). Much slower than a rangefinder or a SLR with split-view ground glass.


	It is the most important asset of the M; quick manual focussing of those petite and beautiful lenses by means of that rangefinder...

	I agree with you regarding allowing tough to focus lenses to be much easier to work with but Leica would never make a $3,500 M mount camera simply because a huge part of the M cachet is price and that price point would devalue the M. Regardless of country of manufacture.

	If they read the ""M11 - your next camera?"" thread - they do NOW! 

	It's rather too bad Leica already used up the label ""M-D"" for the LCD-less digital Ms. And M-E for the end-of-production-life ""leftovers"" digitals. Because what Artin describes would fulfill the function of the film-era MD/MD-2/MDa: ttl-viewing (at most), for appropriate kinds of photography (microscopy, or with the old-school mirror Visoflex and macro/long lenses). Which made a lot of sense when Leitz actually still built microscopes - and/or had not yet developed their own SLR. 

	Reintroducing the ""MD"" in digital form (as, say, an MDb, MD-2e, MDd, or MDe) at this point might be confusing - although a logical progression.


	_______________


	Anyway, as to the ""poll"" - this would never be my go-to camera, which will always have split-image manual focusing (RF/VF, or in a pinch, an SLR with split-image screen).


	It might be a 4th or 5th body, for adjunct/special uses (like the film MD) - probably with an R-M adapter permanently mounted.


	I think the suggested price is overly-optimistic - probably closer to $5K at a minimum. But I won't buy it if I don't have a use for it - regardless of whether it is $3495, or $4995 - or $495. 

	""Not made in Germany"" would not be a big deal as such - for a long while I only used ""Made in Canada"" gear. And also used the Japanese Konica Hexar RF - which had some design bugs, but was built rather nicely. I'd assume Leica would specify that it use their custom M-specific sensor (the wider M lenses require it) - so it won't have an off-the-shelf Sony or Panasonic or ???? sensor.

	Okay, if we take our heads out of our arses for a moment, and look at the cameras Leica provides - Sinar in large format; S in medium format; L mount in APS-C and 135 format; M in 135 format; and then fixed lens 135 Q (ignoring the PanaLeicas), why would Leica make an EVF based M?  The M mount is a bit of a nightmare etc etc etc


	Steve says a bit further back, that’s the Nikon Z7 (which isn’t optimised for M lenses); at times others, Jono included, have said the L mount is the future (with a whole host of things that don’t work with M lenses) …


	But, actually, it’s all about the M mount and its lenses.  That’s the point.  Anything which expands demand and use of M lenses has to be a good thing, surely.  It’s a variant which can be dropped at any time.  Leica makes full frame cameras in M mount, L mount and fixed lens - the only one with an optical rangefinder is the M, yet it has the most loyal following, the most lenses and it’s most precious and unique selling point.  I can’t see why adding a more cost effective EVF version would do anything but increase sales.

	You are. That was in response to a previous poster. I do care where , I care about the quality, technology, Craftsmanship, If they make something that is worth it For me I would purchase it. 
	 Example .. The Nikon Z9. I have no Idea where it will be made could be Japan , Malaysia , China .. does not matter .. technology yes , Craftsmanship possibly good , Overall quality  ahh so so based on their past models like the D5, I hate all the plastic and rubber that comes with them. 5500 us I find it a good Value for what they are giving me .. I will purchase it.  Now if they made it in the same level of the SL2 Craftsmanship. I will gladly pay double. I would care less about the Name tag or where it’s made

	Well, soon enough, there might be a glut of used M10's and there may be more 'disposable' $3-4K M's on the market, not to mention even lower priced 240's. Or just be careful. One reason I eschew fashion leather straps and bags, in favor of Upstraps that stay on your shoulder without shrugging, and Peak or Billingham  bags (btw Peak dividers work great in BH bags).


	What I would like to see with the M moving forward is - gasp! - a change in ergonomics. Enough with the silly add ons in order to be able to hold onto it comfortably for long periods without experiencing carpal, put a bump on the front. Bring back the M3 ridges around the viewfinders to keep fingers from constantly smearing them, a button activated led lamp for the shutter speed dial, back screen flush(er) with the body, etc. I'm one who actually loves the removable base plate, nostalgia mostly I guess. 


	Higher ISO would be nice, but then that cuts into sales of their uber expensive fast lenses!  Faster startup time (I'll bet that Z9 is ready immediately!) and that's about it.

	Let me first say that I love these discussions …Thank you Artin!


	I would for sure, especially if it had the IQ of the M10-R which I really find hard to beat.  I have a pretty solid lineup of cameras, SL2, Q2, Sony A1 but I really like the M10-R for its output, simplicity of the interface, and the compactness of the body.  But I have a hard time focusing it accurately in some use cases, and I am constantly searching around in the viewfinder for the frame lines as I have pretty bad eyes and must wear glasses.  


	The SL2 user interface is great, the EVF is great, but the body is very large in comparison and just doesn’t work for me as an everyday camera or one you would get lost in a city with.


	If the hypothetical camera had the viewfinder of the SL2, and the same sensor and form factor as the M10-R I would be thrilled.   I should note, that without the M Lenses all of this would be mute, they are what makes it really hum and the range of choices is fabulous.  


	 But maybe we should take this a bit further, would it be possible to simulate the rangefinder experience in an EVF?  Or how about a built in autofocus mechanism in the body ( that may be a bit too far for some….)

	Interchangeable lenses for the 35mm format usually feature both focussing and variable aperture as functions of the lens (and not of the body). This is the case also for most M mount lenses. 


	For me 35mm cameras are portable devices that should have the possibility to take pictures fairly rapidly and without a lot of time consuming setting up and adjustments. To be able to achieve this I want my camera body to support setting the functions of the lens, meaning some sort of coupling between body and lens. From this perspective I personally don't see any reason to buy a 35mm camera that does not support any coupling between the body with any type of lens.


	However, I might possibly buy an EVF camera that could take my M lenses without any coupling for ""slower"" shooting, as long as it can also take fully coupled lenses, e.g. L mount, for ""faster"" shooting.

			you guys want, EVF’s, auto focus, a grip, more buttons, more options, 120FPS 5 million dot viewfinder, animal eye AF, real time tracking, and a few zoom lenses, 8K 60p and 4K at 120p. 
			 
		

			just get a Sony or a Canon. If you want fancy dials get a Fuji XH2. 
			 
		

			why can’t we leave the Leica M alone to be a rangefinder? This is a constant talk in forums and YouTube of Leica users wanting the M to become a full frame Fuji. It’s annoying. 
		



	You really just do not understand what you are reading do you ?  Nobody wants to change the M and it’s rangefinder. Some of us are just asking for a more advanced option for the M lenses. And yes the SL2 comes close but it is still not a perfect solution.  Call it whatever just make it native to the M lens. 
	 It is a known fact that the M10R. Which I do own and use, can benefit huge by IBIS. All the longer fast lenses such as the noctilux and Summilux 50s 75s 90s will benefit by a high Rez EVF. Native low ISO. Big +, electronic hi speed shutter of 1/32000. Huge benefit to all fast lenses.

	And any sensor intended for M lenses will be compromised. Many/most of the M lenses were designed befre the days of digital and as a consequence their light paths vary. So will performance. Look at current EVF cameras and lenses and you will be able to read up and appreciated that their designs are integrated. This creates its own set of compromise - mainly size constraints and most are quite large (although some makers are trying to produce at least some smaller lenses. So any camera intended for use with M lenses must be optimised for wide-angles with significantly tricky light paths or these will perform poorly. A sensor optimised for wide lenses may not work sperbly (as is required with recent Leica M lenses) on others. Trying to make the same camera capable of focussing very fast tele lenses will induce other design problems. Its a balancing act with legacy lenses designed for the original mirrorless camera. If there is a profitable marketplace for the camera described in the OP then somone will make it. But I don't see makers rushing out to do so. I wonder why?

	In the first minute you can see how much has already been done in Portugal before the camera arrives for completion in Germany. The chassis, top and bottom plates, rangefinder, shutter, shutter speed dial, shutter release and other controls, hotshoe, most of the electronics and the rear LCD are already in place, but not the sensor (or the Red Dot). The camera arrives in a loosely assembled state, and is then partially disassembled for installation of the sensor, followed by calibration, final reassembly and finishing. Perhaps this has changed since the M9 era, but I don't see anything in the M10 video inconsistent with them following the same process today. Note that the M9 was also labelled 'Made in Germany'. The work that is done in Germany must be legally sufficient for that label. Why anyone should care is another matter. The same high standards apply to all Leica's factories, just as they did to Leitz Canada back in the day.I think the factory in Portugal deserves a lot more credit. My pocket binoculars are entirely made there, but the 'Portugal' label is much more discreet than the 'Germany' label on the cameras.

			I find the Leica M very comfortable. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Adding a grip to it like a Sony would be horrid. It would completely ruin the aesthetics and it is very important to Leica that the M retains its classic look. It is the epitome of the camera. And the way it is now is extremely comfortable. If you need anything else then yes, get an add on grip. 
		



	All I'm doing is questioning how many of the exact same digital M models do we need with incremental interior changes only? Time for them to do something semi-radical - it may sink or swim, but at least it would give some choice (don't like the body changes of the M12? Well, there always the M11, M10-R, etc etc).


	And of course it wouldn't be 'like a Sony' - it would be like a Leica.

			M sensors are designed for M lenses only. The least compromise the better.
		



	But M lenses vary in the way they project the image as demonstrated by the 21mm Super-Angulon. So depending on the M lens you are using, there will be some compromise; probably least with lenses designed for digital M cameras though. Of course, if absolute image 'quality' is not of the highest concern then this isn't a problem. I use an M adapter on both the SL and Sony A series. For many/most shots any differences will almost certainly pass most viewers of the resulting images by.

	Considering that my M9 was purchased for $8K and sold for $3K and my S(006) was purchased for $16K and copies on ebay now sell for around $3K, no, I will not buy any future digital Leica.  


	I know that ""digital decay"" is common on all digital equipment but with the high cost of ""buy in"" on Leica it's a very poor investment.


	On the other hand my MP is worth more than I paid for it as was the M7 I sold for the MP.  I love the results from the S(006) and will keep it until it dies  but analog Leica is the future for me.

The main components were manufactured in Portugal since the late 1980s when old Wetzlar machines were transferred to Portugal.

	I don't know that there's room for semi-radical between conservative (M) and radical (SL). They've already made the decision that if you want a 'modern' camera, you either use your old-style lenses with an adapter, or buy the new lenses, much as they did when they switched from the LTM to the M system nearly 70 years ago.

			In the first minute you can see how much has already been done in Portugal before the camera arrives for completion in Germany. The chassis, top and bottom plates, rangefinder, shutter, shutter speed dial, shutter release and other controls, hotshoe, most of the electronics and the rear LCD are already in place, but not the sensor (or the Red Dot). The camera arrives in a loosely assembled state, and is then partially disassembled for installation of the sensor, followed by calibration, final reassembly and finishing. Perhaps this has changed since the M9 era, but I don't see anything in the M10 video inconsistent with them following the same process today. Note that the M9 was also labelled 'Made in Germany'. The work that is done in Germany must be legally sufficient for that label. Why anyone should care is another matter. The same high standards apply to all Leica's factories, just as they did to Leitz Canada back in the day.I think the factory in Portugal deserves a lot more credit. My pocket binoculars are entirely made there, but the 'Portugal' label is much more discreet than the 'Germany' label on the cameras.
		



	This is a video of the German factory (with German people) making a Leica M9 from beginning to end.

	All you can really say is that the majority of rangefinder cameras can be described as having been made to incorporate some form of a messsucher design. Once you start to get in to M-cameras you are talking about one particular model-series (M-mount) from one particular manufacturer.


	Leica's earlier LTM model II and III bodies, for instance, can not accurately be described as being Leica M cameras.

	The perpetual need for wanting enhanced technology in, for what is simply a tool, can also be an excuse for lack of adaptive skill…..an extension of a ‘bad craftsperson always blames his tool’ but in this case ‘a not so good craftsperson always wants their tool to do something more or different because if it did their product would be so much better.’ 


	Well the ‘more’ is already here enabling the ‘so much better’  if you perceive things that way.  It might not be in the ‘M’ format but that wouldn’t really matter to a craftsperson as the make and model of the tool doesn’t matter, it’s the REAL need for the specific enhanced offering which does. Be it a Sony Fuji Nikon SL CL Q etc. The craftsperson recognizes the need - sometimes - for a different tool so they simply pick it up and work with it regardless. They don’t expect it to feel the same or perform the same as their other tools  - they never could or should because they are there for different reasons.


	The problem emerges when the belief is that the tool makes the craftsperson  - understandable because  that save time thinking, looking and acquiring skill. The emphases partially switches from ones brain, sensitivity and eyes to the technical brain sensitivity and optics of the tool.  Why do you want that?? Well because if not I would miss the shot. What shot?  Well the 120th of a second thing which just happened which we couldn’t see well enough let alone normally hold my hand steady enough to take it.


	Why did you think that was important to capture?  Because it won’t happen gain and that’s why I need a camera which does everything. Ah….so you have this camera so you can take photos of everything which happens? No but I have to be ready for when ‘it’ happens  but it’s not just about the camera, I’ll select the ones which the camera does well. How many of those do you think there would be? Well the camera takes about 100 - 200k photos a year and probably I select about 100 which are good….which are keepers. 
	Ok….well if you ever consider taking less photos  and want to spend more time looking and selecting moments and thinking and looking again and then refining those moments…like me for example….  I take around 300 photos a year and hope to have maybe 10 of those which I particularly like. My best photographic days are when I go out without my camera but just go out to look compose and feel. Later I revisit but take my camera. Or sometimes there are those special moments which I just have to photographically engage with….and sometimes they are so so special they don’t deserve a photograph…..


	Well  if you want to slow down then I could recommend a camera called the Leica M. It’s a tool which doesn’t get in the way and encourages the craft of looking. People are trying to change it but luckily they have old ones which are mechanical and they can’t change….they are even better.

	I'm firmly in the rangefinder camp when it comes to Leica. I use digital Leica M cameras professionally, just as I used film Ms before. That said, I'd buy an EVF ""M"" style camera (full frame, M lenses) in a heartbeat if it were offered at $3500 new. I just don't see that price happening with Leica, though.


	I would pass on that body if it were in the same price range as the M10-P or M10-R. I have Canon mirrorless professional cameras that suit my needs just fine that are a lot more flexible for me.

	The very reason is what you have been discussing here. a New camera like that in native M mount will open up a huge opportunity to take advantage of both the older lenses with their unique signatures , and the new lenses that have the best available IQ. 


	 And to answer the other post as for a Q with interchangeable lenses yes it would be a huge hit.. I would buy one in a heart beat.. 


	The whole reason and purpose is to have a more advanced option for 70+ years of optics available to us

			Try the Sony 20/1.8 and 21mm Super-Elmar and say that 😁. Sony make some very good lenses indeed. These are new designs built for use with their A series cameras and whilst nowhere near as small as the M lenses they can provide exceptional image quality.
		



	Not the point i was making sorry if i wasn't clear. I was not referring to Sony lenses i have no experience with. Only Sony bodies i know well like my Kolari mod A7s and A7r2.

	The reason why you don't see that option is that the uniqueness of the Q allows Leica to not have to compete on price with other manufacturers.


	Same goes for the M which is why as much as I like the idea of your hypothetical camera, I don't see Leica bringing it to market at the price point you stated.

	Actually lot (probably all) of digital cameras provide some level of in-camera correction for its native lenses.


	I think it has been observed that with every new generation of M camera some of the “problematic” lenses starting to behave better (just an opinion).  Ok some lenses may be beyond correction but we are talking minority of historical wide angle lenses, all in all a Leica camera with M mount regardless of viewing/focusing means should have sensor stack and firmware optimised for own lenses, after all lens detection is not just for show.

	I own several multi-thousand dollar M lenses that significantly underperform, unacceptably so, on the SL2.  When compared to the same lens on the 10-R or a native L optic costing far less, the loss of fidelity and smearing in the corners is obvious. This is fact, not conjecture and has been demonstrated several times on these pages. Physics dictates that any M lens which projects at higher levels of incidence will underperform noticeably up to and beyond 1k by 1K in the corners when mounted to anything other than an M.  From practical experience, thats anything from 35mm on down. One assumes Leica didn't go to all the trouble and expense to provide micro-lensing and thinest cover glass possible just for fun;  the simplest of comparisons demonstrates what motivated them.

	Regardless of how most of us feel,  I really think it is inevitable, sooner then later Leica will jump into the compact full frame market. I just wish , but I am not that hopeful that it will be a manual focus platform and most likely it will not be using the M mount which again will somewhat justify by adapters. It will most likely be the evolution of the Q .. and again it will be an ungainly outfit with a whale of a lens sticking in front of a compact body and totally disappoint me. So I will stick to what is available and just keep on taking pictures.

	I'd be intrigued by an M-mount and M-lens-compatible-sensor that is designed for use with an accessory optical finder (i.e., exposure/warning lights visible while using it) but uses the electronic display(s) for focusing. It could then adjust exposure and contrast to reveal focus without regard to exposure or framing. If a custom sensor (not just a stack), the live-view readout area could be limited to achieve power, temperature, and architectural benefits.


	This could just be a mode on pretty much any electronic-finder camera with a thin-filter mod: default to magnified view, etc. But, ergonomics are critical and I'm not sure anyone other than Leica or Cosina would have the institutional experience to get the interface right.


	With an accessory-finder-oriented design, I'd consider an EVF M... although it'd have to have benefits that go beyond a previous-gen messsucher M at the same price point.


	Skeptical but persuadable.

	I must say, I’m baffled by the discussion of an interchangeable lens Q camera.  What is it about the Q that people want to turn into a system?


	The Q has autofocus, a dedicated sensor/lens combination, with a leaf shutter.  So such a camera would demand a new sensor, compatible with other lenses and a new line of leaf shutter lenses … you couldn’t use M lenses, unless the camera switched to an electronic shutter.


	Conversely, the existing M camera already has a body, mount, shutter, sensor, processor etc compatible with almost all of coming on for 70 years of lenses.


	The choice, I would have thought, (if Leica is developing a new body) is between a smaller SL or an EVF M.  The SL is a universal platform for almost every Leica lens.  Why would they make it smaller?  The only gap, surely, is an M mount camera that is full frame, the size of the M or Q that is also manual focus - BUT with an EVF ….

	What it sounds like to me is a hybrid SL2 with an M mount.  With just manual focus and no rangefinder you would just have focus peaking or nothing.  Might not be too bad with a focus-zoom aid, but it seems like critical focus might be hard to achieve.  


	All the other specs sound good but it wouldn't be for me without a decent focusing system.

	While I'm in sync with your post, in thinking about it, one could imagine an FF X1D if you will. Nothing to do with an M evf, of course. Presumably L mount. Perhaps the writing is on the wall for the S and someday we'll see some versions of L glass with leaf shutters for studio use, though could they be compact enough for a Q style camera?  Dunno. Could be an interesting camera though.

"

	The big draw back of autofocus is the sheer size of the lenses. Specifically the sheer size of the fast lenses. Take a look at a simple difference in the Sl 50 summilux vs the M summilux.. this is where the sheer advantage of my hypothetical camera comes into play.. and in all honesty my biggest attraction to the M system has always been the lenses. I love shooting wide open fast lenses , in my opinion it sets the mood and the drama of an image. And the amount of fast lenses available in the M system new or legacy is just not served well enough with the current lineup of  M cameras. 
	 Most every other systems offer numerous options at different price levels and capabilities. What we get for the M is just very thin in my opinion

	21mm.  I'm sure some perform better than others and I'd be the first to agree that there are many circumstances where'd you'd never notice a problem.  Corners are often OoF anyway or contain nothing of interest. Close focusing diminishes the angle of incidence lessening the effect and typically involves OoF backgrounds where any smearing could be put down to bokeh and might actually be welcome anyway.  My annoyance with this subject is partially due to my own collection of wide glass which sees a lot of use and tends to fares poorly, but also with the hit or miss nature of what works, what doesn't and under what circumstances... particularly for the sums involved.  It's why an adapted EVF solution for M glass is a non starter with me, unless the sensor has the same attributes of the M (microlensing, thin cover glass).

	I agree you take your pick with M lenses on other bodies (hence my comment that any such EVF based camera would be best starting from an M10 or M11 camera), but as generalisations go, it's fair to say that M lenses work best with cameras designed for them - an M camera of an SL.  I'm ignoring APS and other cropped formats, as they just take the centre of the image field.

	However, the appeal of an EVF camera with an M mount would be limited to a not too large percentage of existing Leica M users. Many of that group would reject a non-RF camera.
	The appeal of a mirrorless camera that has none of the functions of  competitors and needs lenses that cost many thousands to the rest of the photographic world will be close to nil.
	How many of such cameras could Leica expect to sell? No more than the average. special edition, I would say. How much would the development cost?  Far more than an average special edition. 


	So what price could we expect? Fill in your own number of zeroes...

	Is there really no market for a small, light, modern high IQ APSC or FF mirrorless interchangeable lens camera with a minimalist but capable interface? Has Leica given that market up to Fuji? If nothing else, Leica has shown that the M form factor, simple in shape and interface, is attractive to quite a lot of people. One lesson from the Q is that it can be styled like an M, but with modern tech, and sell well (I assume........).

One lesson from the Q is that it can be styled like an M, but with modern tech, and sell well (I assume........).
		



	The CL has full mirrorless capability and is integrated in the L system. The q has plenty of modern features. An EVF M would lack all modern tech, that is the point.

	I have the S5 now. happy: all M-lenses except one work. Great to use manual SLR lenses to, such as my old 50/100mm macro zoom. Big? Sure but I like the seamless focussing and the excellent quality in all distances. And the results are great: IBIS works to help me out and the speed can be set to 4.000 and even 20.000 asa. . . And of course the EVF is great. (But I would like the big res one, if that also is enlarged more). 
	When I use the lens profiles in  Lightroom I even get a great result in reducing the vignetting.
	So what I would like is an S5 with a native M-bayonet or 6-bit M-to-L adapter that reads the six-bits and  and sets the RAW capture accordingly. The Maestro then  corrects the corners and field curvature for instance. 
The corner correction is obvious. Each M-lens has a different fall-off.
The effect of lens correction is large, I tried a 35mm Lux profile and a Cron profile on a 35mm Cron picture and you can see the correction of the linearity taking place. Interesting what is going on in the background.)
But it can also correct fuzzy effects.
And most important:  IT IS NEEDED for IBIS.

			We are discussing a full frame camera, designed and made by Leica with an M mount, but with an EVF, aren't we?
		



	And crucially, sans OVF of course, excepting...

			I'd be intrigued by an M-mount and M-lens-compatible-sensor that is designed for use with an accessory optical finder (i.e., exposure/warning lights visible while using it) but uses the electronic display(s) for focusing.
		



	It had occurred to me that an Mevf could use any of the existing optical finders on the hot shoe, much like the GRIII, but bravo, it's a very clever notion to consider something more sophisticated.  One could imagine an auxiliary hybrid optical finder, electronically coupled to the camera via the hot shoe with the ability to project not only the above, but frames lines depending on lens detected, perhaps even a magnified focus patch or as I suggest below, a simple focusing aid. 


	It was discussed previously in a different context, but the notion of a focus confirmation light has come up in the past. Such a feature might be able to be implemented by reusing  existing contrast detect code AF code minus the drive motor logic to signal the user via a light flash that the image (in some central bounding box, or movable point) is seen to be in focus.  My decade+ old 645D does something similar for older non-AF lenses or when in MF mode, flashing a red light when focus is hit. Perhaps these days something more sophisticated is possible with the light glowing brighter or dimmer or changing color to indicate how close/far out one is. Regardless, if we imagine an EVF based camera with a hot shoe capable of accepting an add on electro/optical finder that projects frame lines and generates a focus confirm, one could retain the critical aspects of the RF experience (OVF, seeing outside the lines) with the exception of having an actual focus patch and losing the double frame lines for a single one.


	With the current M we have a built-in OVF with an option add-on external EVF, with the new Leica W, which I so christen as such a camera turns the current model upside down, we have a camera with built-in EVF with and add-on OVF.  Personally, I think this could be killer... which is another reason to call it the W range as I suspect more than a few purists might go apoplectic at such heresy... W being an M that has gone legs up. 😆

And most important: Automatic transfer of lensdata IS NEEDED for IBIS. 
IBIS is very complex. 
While we think we have a '50mm lens', that exists almost nowhere. In fact, as Fiftyonepointsix knows, it is most often, 51,6mm, with some variances written on the lens. The shake reduction uses it to apply the correct amount. In the S5, I can enter ist as 51.6; my 35mm cron becomes a 36,something mm for instance, the M-Elmar 24 a 25mm. Its all very sophisticated.
And secondly, to perform a great handling, the lensdata should also transfer the data where the midpoint of the lens is, often the same place where the diaphragm is. (probably not in the Elmarit 90mm not for instance).
So the 6-bit should be a central part for a good 'mirrorless M camera'.
The other heart of the matter is of course a 6 million pixel viewfinder, a bit bigger magnification please than the S5, and please please: not blue but have it behave a bit better in colour.
Expensive? No, just let Panasonic developd the new body with the S5 as a template and have Leica do the the lens integration, the combo would happily serve the market with a price just like the S5.
I would never do away the rangefinder. In fact, the S5 made me look out to a 24MP BIS body . . My experience: at last we will have a CCD look again.

	Fortunately not . Suffice it to enter the focal length in a menu, at least on my Sony. Should work the same on your Panasonic i guess but i have no experience with it. Now i would prefer a mirrorless camera with an M mount and 6-bit coding of course but when i see some conservative reactions here i suspect it won't happen before long, at Leica at least.

	Yes but with no auto zoom for your M lenses and a jack of all trade sensor. Hence soft corners in FF mode with lenses like M 21/3.4 asph and 28/2 at fast apertures. MATE and WATE would do better but f/4 only...

	Yes, you are right there are some disadvantages.


	Therefore, the CL is best for Tl lenses.  But if the alternative was that I had to lug around a heavy SL2, then this is better.  It's a compromise ☺️

	I think they listen to us because we've demonstrated that we are willing to buy the M system regardless of cost. The M11 will most likely break the $10k barrier. I doubt that will adversely effect anyone on this forum's decision to buy one.

	I attended a recent event at Wetzlar with Peter Karbe, and the old farts (your words, not mine) actually dominated the room. I, being of median age, was amongst the youngest in the audience. The old farts were singing the same thousands of years old song of the loss of culture of our youth and how everything is bad today and will be worse tomorrow. This topic is so boring and, notably, factually wrong. Never before have average people had as many opportunities to create as these days. Never has there be more media consumption, media creation and media savvyness. YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, they all require decent image capturing gear and the younger ones are actually very interested in good quality equipment. The problem is that their needs are different than what are Leica‘s core competencies. The TikTok generation needs excellent video capabilities, image stabilization, speed etc.. They are also willing to pay decent money for decent gear, for what THEY find appealing.


	Other morituri in the field have arisen from the dead bed because they realized that. To serve those customers or not is a strategic decision every company has to make. There are many examples of industries mostly disappearing because they refused to listen to the customer‘s needs. Well, you get what you deserve.


	Coming back to the topic, I still would like to see a camera as suggested by the TS.

	Perhaps I'm an outlier, but as a (relatively) young person, I appreciate the direction that Leica has taken with the M. True, I sold my M10 last year for an SL2-S, but that was in anticipation of the M11 - and I will continue to buy digital Leica Ms over any other variant in the future. I also have an MP that I've been using more than the SL2-S. I prefer the form factor, the feel, and the design of the M.


	I like the idea of an M with a digital viewfinder and think it would sell like hotcakes (if done correctly). Practically, it would eliminate the issues we have with rangefinder adjustment and focusing, which is especially problematic for shooting fast lenses wide open.


	On the other hand, I also really love having an optical viewfinder. It isn't just for nostalgic reasons since I enjoy composing through the viewfinder that way and there are also battery savings. If I don't want to shoot wide open, especially for street or venturing out, I much prefer the optical viewfinder.


	I think this is exactly why so many are pining for the upgraded electronic viewfinder attachment. An M11 with an upgraded attachment would probably scratch the itch for 80% of folks out there.


	Finally, if you check out instagram or various other photo sites, you'll see plenty of younger folks with Leicas. The issue is really one of cost moreso than an interest in the latest features. Millennials/Zoomers are not as rich as the older generations, but I'm sure they would HAPPILY take Leica donations. 😉

	Maybe Leica was thinking the same back in the early 60s and decided that there was no future for the M line, because soon only old farts would buy them. Then they decided to put most of thir efforts into developing SLRs, which was what young people would like to buy (and actually did buy, but maybe not the expensive Leica ones) and nearly terminated the M line.


	Now all the old farts of the 60s are gone, but for some odd reason some still buy Leica M cameras. Maybe the young photographers of the 60s and 70s who, like me, never would have purchased an M camera back then, now have found them and also have the money to buy?

	Morning ramble:


	For 90% of the population, the two best cameras on the market are the iPhone 13 Pro and Pixel 6 Pro. They just are, and will take care of a great portion of what most people want/need to do with a camera, and do it very well. In fact more often then not I think the average person, even 'photo enthusiasts,' are hampered by traditional camera vs phone cameras. If one can't take a decent pic with the new crop of phones, forget about it with a traditional camera.  I often see amateur pics that look stale and hobbled and poorly framed despite there being $15k work of camera behind it. M's are not an easy beast to use, or at least use fluidly, without years of practice. Beautiful objects, pleasing to hold and handle and look at, which for most might be enough. The ""Tik Tok Generation"" doesn't have years. People are also now addicted or used to ease and an all-in-one ethos. Perhaps why the Q series has done so well.


	For me the M's are liberating in a way sir or evf cameras somehow always felt limiting, or as if I was too tethered to. And I think that comes down to the fact one isn't actually seeing what is being made by the camera, so it's easier for me to be looser with an M, and tear myself away from the viewfinder. I would say for a good 60% of my (people and active) shots I'm not looking through the viewfinder at all, or just partially - just a quick confirmation of focus and then off to find new angles and concentrate on the moment. I love the sprinkle of randomness the M's give, and the fact that I can take the photo no matter what. I always used my Nikon's primarily in full manual mode as well expect for special circumstances or lenses (and then it's hallelujah for auto focus etc). 


	So yeah, the M will always be a niche market, and consequently why one constantly sees so many on the used market (impressive and lustworthy in the store; perhaps not so much in real world use for many). But the M is also Leica's legacy, and it's what sets it apart from other camera companies, no matter what else they put out. So I don't see a M mash up in the cards. It would be something else entirely and stand alone, and sink or swim on its own merits.

	I think your underestimating young people/photographers ,i am always out and about with my leica m262 and often bump into young photographers with big canon kits or even olympus epl-7 discontinued cameras but they often recognise my camera type and avidly discuss both my camera and theirs.


	The know how and awareness of many 20-30 year old photographers i meet is impressive and they are mostly very savvy and aware of the camera market and many are genuinely interested in the camera i have  with me ,just as i am with their gear.


	Some of us older photographers love the simplicity of the leica m but the very same thing applies to many younger people on my view.


	Personally i  believe a very simple rangefinder camera appeals to a decent number of young people and leica know it.

Then I have been told ditching the rangefinder for an EVF would make the camera cheaper to manufacture. Let the marketplace decide, Leica.

	So they need to make the M-CS (Cranky Senior) model? 


	Ok, just kidding. They could certainly use some ergonomic improvement, but the rf isn't one of them, and I'd be on the fence about IBIS depending on how it's implemented. Really starting to move away from the M 'purity' ethos here. Of course without adding some bells and whistles Leica has kind of backed themselves into a corner with the M line.  But if one goes back and looks at the classic pictures taken by Leica's the most important ones in history. Sharpness isn't the end all be all. In fact many of the photos would have suffered from being so called 'perfect.' Or if you want absolute clarity, you may need to slow down and experiment using a tripod, or perhaps a bigger sensor camera.

	If we think that Leica should branch the current line of digital M cameras into an EVF branch and an OVF/RF branch, both with a native M mount, do we think Leica would be able to maintain both branches also in the future? Or would they eventually be forced to terminate either branch (or, in the worst case both) because of excessive development costs and too few customers for that branch?

	An MF only camera using EVF needs auto-aperture-stop-down to allow quick focusing. That is not possible with M lenses.

			Or if you want absolute clarity, you may need to slow down and experiment using a tripod, or perhaps a bigger sensor camera.  
		



	In a different thread not so long ago someone wrote: ""The problem with the whole ""maybe you should use something else' type of comment is that it comes off as the pinnacle of mansplaining."" 

	Just kidding, but you are right, they have backed themselves into a corner with the M, it's not new either. The thing is, a lot of people enjoy using it as it is and accept that it's not a state of the art image making machine. I think they would be making a big mistake trying to add features that just don't belong on this type of camera. Video support is an example. Part of the skill of a photographer is knowing her/his equipement including it's disatvantages as well as it's strong points. I think that in general M users have a certain attachement to the format and their gear, sometimes it's hard to face the facts of life and we will all suffer from diminishing eye sight at some time. Nudging users who are dissapointed with the M or are just unable to use it for whatever reason is simply pointing out that there may be other options better suited to them.

	I am very happy with the cataract surgery. But I have 2 specs now and a somewhat dry eye. One pair of specs for the close distance is necessary and an optimized pair for a still better view in the distance. My wife has worse complications (dry eyes, flashes), but the view is better. 


	My age was 76 in 2014. In between the surgery of the eyes (1 year) the world was colored (yellowbrown) somewhat. Jim Kasson has measured the color cast in his case, I have forgotten to do this.

	Imagining something like this is as far as it will go. To fit contacts would take up room. This would limit any new lenses in many ways. The solution would be to make such a camera with a larger diameter bayonet mount and then provide an M adapter. Now wait a minute, why didn't Leica think of that (🤔), or did they (🙃)?

	The one change that I want for M is a built-in adjustable diopter. That would be sweet and could probably be done with minimal form factor modification.

	I like this idea. It would not necessarily mean AF lenses, but could as long as the compact size is maintained.

	There is plenty of room there already on the mount, just as there was for the 6 bits. Might it require something a little more mechanically sophisticated to avoid excessive contact wear, but I'd wager they could figure it out.

	Possibly, but one has to wonder the opposite. Can the existing M offerings, lenses and all, survive a serious global economic downturn given the current and suspected future pricing levels? Leveraging M software, hardware and optics in support of a lower cost platform might help save the RF version rather than kill it.

	I think it would depend on how close the two would be from a technical perspective. For example, if Leica managed to make a hybrid evf/ovf camera, they could possibly make a lower cost evf-only version without that many modifications. Like the M1 and MD where there were more or less just parts left out, or to some degree the M10-D.


	My point was that if the two were too different designs it might become too expensive to maintain both. And all digital designs need to be at least ""refreshed"" from time to time because components, particularly sensors, become unavailable fairly quickly. A completely different case to maintain production capability for e.g. a film MP

	I'd wager that they can't and won't. No other maker has fitted electronic contacts where the 6-bit coding is. There is a very good reason.

	The eyesight adjuster was standard in the mid 1930’s and a factory upgrade for earlier cameras.

	Yes, the 6-bit coding is really close to the edge, so it could be a bit tight. But the real challenge would probably be to get anything new to fit into the lens barrel, even if the mechanical rangefinder coupling was removed. So a Summicron-M+ might be the size of a Noctilux-M...
