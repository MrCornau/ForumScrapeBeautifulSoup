	Why not just shove an adapter on the mirrorless camera of your choice, or wait for the SL3?

	If a camera has no rangefinder it canâ€™t be an M.

	Since this is a hypothetical question, my answer would be a ""yes"" - hypothetically, of course.


	I would not buy the hypothetical Japan made camera instead of an M11 but as an adjunct to the M11.


	All the above is contingent upon my suddenly experiencing an unexpected financial windfall so that I would have the hard currency to buy both hypothetical cameras.Â  As it turns out, attempting to buy any M camera or lens with hypothetical money yields the same end result as attempting to buy with the much ballyhooed ""exposure dollars"" that companies who want photographers to work for free always dangle in front of us.

	Â The 'M' stands forÂ MesssucherÂ or rangefinder in German. However the M1 and the MD series seemÂ not to obeyÂ that rule.

	Sure they doâ€¦. M doesnâ€™t stand for Monitorâ€¦ the RF remains.

	The M stands for Messsucher or Rangefinder which the M1 and MD do not have.

	For me the second option is well covered with so many other mirrorless cameras on the market for some years now. Besides if your mystery cameraÂ is Leica FF @Â $3500...hell did in fact freeze over and we have other problems to deal withÂ ðŸ˜‰ðŸ™ƒ


	Seriously, IMO the SL2/S are such great options with all the mirrorless bells and whistles for adapting M lenses and on the shelves available for purchase as I type its really hard to dream of anything else.


	The Leica Rangefinder is howeverÂ a completely different love affair for me. Not really looking for another lovely at the moment. As the M10-R is Simply Irresistible according to Robert Palmer's definition. *May he RIP.Â
