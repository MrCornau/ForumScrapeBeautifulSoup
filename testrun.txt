I'm coming from an M10-P, and I'm still super impressed. The fears of a 40MP rangefinder being difficult/impossible were focus were far overblown - I found no difference in practice. Also, the fears that the jump to 40mp would compromise low light performance were also unfounded; I found low light/high ISO performance to be as good or better as in the M10-P.\u00a0\n\n\n\tOne thing I found to be interesting was that the auto-ISO\u00a0metering seemed to be more conservative on the M10-R than the M10-P (I think I also read this in one of the reviews). I found my M10-P often required -.3 or -.7 exposure comp when using auto ISO (especially in challenging/high contrast\u00a0lighting conditions) or else it would be liable to blow highlights. On the M10-R, I found I could run without any exposure comp. adjustments and the camera's meter would mostly get it spot on.\u00a0\n\n\n\tHere's a small album of pictures from tonight - all shot with a 50APO, most wide open or close to it.

I haven't gotten a chance yet to rigorously test how high ISO settings affect highlight recovery, but I can confirm that highlight recovery is in general noticeably improved over the m10-p. I had my settings accidentally off\u00a0for a shot and overexposed by ~2 stops, and when I looked at the LCD preview, I figured the highlights were irretrievably blown (based on my experience looking at similarly overexposed shots on the m10-p). However, when I got into lightroom, I was able to recover essentially all of the detail in the highlights, which was pleasantly surprising. That was an ISO 1600 shot, though."}, {"autor:": "SrMi", "posts": "1,854 posts", "date": "07/25/2020 03:58  PM", "content": "Apo-Summicron-M 1:2/50 ASPH\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nHello guest!

Not a massive difference though. I saw much bigger differences in the SL. (That just gets to be a better and better camera in my view).\n\u00a0\nThe more I look at the M10, the nicer it looks. Video isn't an issue for me... so the M10 would be a good fit, but I'm not remotely concerned about the thinner body (perhaps because I have never owned a Leica film M, so body size isn't an unconsciously learned 'thing' for me (I suspect most wonders complaining about M8/9240 body width are previous or existing film owners).\n\u00a0\nI will still wait for the M10-P as I like my M240P too much to be able to justify the expense of changing right now... I may not even change then, I'll just keep my powder dry for a while.\n\u00a0\nHad it been an EVF or hybrid viewfinder, I would have bought one immediately as I have said before... so if an M EVF or an ML or QL or whatever, appears in the next few months, maybe Leica will get my money then.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut it looks like a great camera and it will please a LOT of Leica owners who have had a M8/9 or returned to film as they thought the M digitals were too bloated (not that I agree).\n\u00a0\nCongratulations to Leica though.

It is a mild, grey day in D.C., and of course the gardens are as you'd expect in mid-Winter. \u00a0But I hope these quickly taken images give you a sense of what the new M is like in the field.\n\u00a0\nEverything written so far by Jono and Sean Reid and others about the intelligent menu system and the advantage of the ISO dial struck me as just right. \u00a0While it is is smaller in the hand, you don't notice that while carrying it around -- in fact, never have I been so conscious of a camera's weight! \u00a0It feels like... an M. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut there are some immediate things I noticed. \u00a0First, the EVF is a delight to use, though, yes, there is some hang time still. \u00a0Less than the M-240's EVF, but more than the SL's. In late February 2013, when I took out the M-240 for the first time, the resulting colors seemed quite bright, and I found myself muting them in LR. The colors on my computer screen seem precisely as they were when I took the images. \u00a0This seems to be the most natural color rendering of the any digital M to date. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis Saturday, the Woman's March will be in DC and hundreds of thousands will be here to protest our soon-to-be president...

I'd say that, in \"normal\" use with low ISOs there is not much difference, though there are differences. I think as one goes up the ISO scale the M10 will draw further ahead as one would expect. If you are just shooting at lowish ISOs then image quality alone probably wouldn't be sufficient to justify a switch.\n\u00a0\nIn my case I really like the ISO dial, and wifi will be very handy for dragging pics down without removing a tripod plate and the base plate. Remote control will be very useful to me as well. Handling the M10 the weight difference seems negligible, but the thinness is noticeable.\n\u00a0\nI also found the viewfinder nicer but I'm not sure why. It seemed easier to get focus and I thought the rangefinder patch could be larger than the 240, but comparing side by side it seems to be the same.\n\u00a0\nSo, if you're going to change up, don't expect revolutionary image quality improvements unless you are up at higher ISOs.

Once the camera and phone are paired, its quite fast to connect and stable. I basically got used to just flicking the camera to Wifi, letting it boot up for about 10 seconds (while carrying on doing other things and not just staring a the green light blinking)\u00a0and then going into the FOTOS app to pair the camera to phone. I have used the app for remote shooting. I also did a mini shoot for one of my friends before. The camera was paired for about 30mins so I could review pics on the go and it worked great the whole time.\n\tI've since sold my M10D to someone on the forum\u00a0and do miss it sometimes. Prices are rising too.\u00a0It's the perfect colour camera for me,\u00a0of all the colour cameras out there right now. Sure, i have my list of things it could improve on, but that improved version does not exist (and may never). If i chose 1 colour camera today, that would be it. There was also a\u00a0point of time I set the M10D to shoot in RAW + B&W JPEG. All the pictures displayed in the app were B&W JPEG. I was too lazy to edit pictures during that phase and simply downloaded the pictures from the app into my phone and used them from there..so I essentially had an M10-D Monochrom.\n\n\n\tThat thumb rest...it's really some thumb rest. That and the slimness of the body without the screen are what I miss the most. Your hand falls nicely into place with the thumb rest and without the LCD in the way.\n\n\n\tSide thing, for some reason this thread reminded me of some M10D i stumbled upon on Schouten a few months back.

Of all of those the Nikons were easily the most heavily used with the larger format cameras running second and chosen per' their suitability for each shoot, Leica M's had their place for sure but they weren't the workhorses as were the others, at least in my experience.

I loved the Leica M's back then, still do now as I own several of differing flavours, but they weren't as bullet proof as the Nikons that's for sure and tended to go out as B cameras unless the situation required quieter gear, ( rarely so in my field of work then ).\u00a0Many PJ's liked the Leica M's back then for sure, but here again\u00a0the Nikons tended to rule too with the M's used for wider lenses and the SLR's for better reach with fast telephoto's.\n\n\n\tOnly when I was working in film and around film-sets in the 80's and 90's in the US did the Leica M's\u00a0come back into their own whilst Nikons were encased in Blimps to quieten them and make their operation rather awkward..........But yes you're right,\u00a0for the days of rock and roll right up to digital times Nikons and\u00a0Hassies\u00a0ruled."}, {"autor:": "Jeff S", "posts": "18,648 posts", "date": "09/22/2021 02:43  PM", "content": "The M is different; no other company still regularly produces rangefinder cameras. \u00a0Part of the allure is the legacy and backward compatibility of virtually all M lenses ever produced. \u00a0A unique customer base and marketing opportunity.\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\tThe other Leica products present different marketing challenges and opportunities. \u00a0So, too, might a future M, if and when an EVF or hybrid VF comes to pass.\n\n\n\tJeff"}, {"autor:": "Al Brown", "posts": "595 posts", "date": "09/22/2021 03:18  PM", "content": "Leica M has brutally rich historic legacy and is itself a niche product.
